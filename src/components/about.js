                            <h3>About HDFC Bank</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited or HDFC Ltd was among the first financial institutions in India to receive an “in principle” approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a bank in the private sector. This was done as part of RBI’s policy for liberalisation of the Indian banking industry in 1994.

                                HDFC Bank was incorporated in August 1994 in the name of HDFC Bank Limited, with its registered office in Mumbai, India. The bank commenced operations as a Scheduled Commercial Bank in January 1995.


                                On April 4, 2022 the merger of India’s largest Housing Finance Company, HDFC Limited and the largest private sector bank in India, HDFC Bank was announced. HDFC Ltd, over the last 45 years has developed one of the best product offerings making it a leader in the housing finance business.

                            <p>
                                HDFC Ltd was founded in 1977, when the Late Shri. HT Parekh, Founder and Chairman of HDFC Ltd, dreamt of millions of middle-class citizens of India owning a home and not having to wait till their retirement. Pioneering India’s housing finance industry, the late Shri. Parekh, a Padma Bhushan recipient, built HDFC Ltd on a strong foundation of integrity, transparency, and professionalism. Taking the legacy further Mr. Deepak Parekh, Chairman HDFC Ltd. and a Padma Bhushan awardee, not only made HDFC the leader in Mortgages, but also transformed it into India's leading Financial Services conglomerate with a presence in Banking, Asset Management, Life Insurance, General Insurance, Real Estate Venture Fund, Education Loans and Education.
